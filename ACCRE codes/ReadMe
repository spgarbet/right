This folder contains ACCRE codes for running Clopidogrel single-drug model. First run 10 batches of model (c0-c9, only vary in random seeds and file name of results), and then combine and run analyses (c10_top). 

With majority of simulation files untouched, “extra” files substitute for “right-main-simulation” files and post-simulation analyses use “costs” files (both included in this folder). 

*Use "extra" and "costs_ICER" for standard 10-year simulation.
*Use "extra_immortal" and "costs_new" for simulation eliminating secular death and discounting.

*Random Seeds:
0 -> 12345
1 -> 54321
2 -> 1501
3 -> 268
4 -> 34
5 -> 3905
6 -> 476
7 -> 325
8 -> 5
9 -> 10
